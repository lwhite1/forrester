Forrester is a java implementation of a Systems Dynamics simulation engine. System Dynamics can be used to model complex systems with feedback loops (such as when hurrying increases productivity in the short-term, but decreases it in the long-term due to mistakes), significant delays, non-linear interactions, etc. 

There have been many models developed in ecology, project management, software development, business strategy and operations, medicine/biology, politics and international relations, etc.

System dynamics models are often used for training, sometimes structured as games where teams compete.

This application would be intended to be the basis for some specific models and dashboards that could be used for training, planning, and/or scenario testing.
